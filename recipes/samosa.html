        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) is a fried South Asian pastry with a savoury filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, meat or fish. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
            <li> teaspoon raisins</li>
            <li>5 boiled potato</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kasoori methi leaves</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon carom seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 cup virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon green chilli</li>
            <li> teaspoon cashews</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
            <li>salt as required</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon coriander leaves</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon ghee</li>
            <li>1 handful raw peanuts</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>
                <p>The first step is to cook the potatoes and peas for the savory and spiced filling.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To cook the potatoes and peas in a stovetop pressure cooker: Place 3 medium-sized whole potatoes (300 to 450 grams) and 2 to 2.5 cups water in a 3 or 4 litre pressure cooker. On top of the potatoes carefully set a small trivet and pressure cooker-safe bowl with ½ cup green peas. Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles or 7 to 8 minutes on medium to medium-high flame.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For the stovetop pressure cooker, remove the lid after all the pressure falls in the cooker.</li>
            <li>Next, roast or toast the spices. This will help to release their flavors and should not be skipped!</li>
            <li>Remove the spices from the heat and allow to cool completely. Then, put them in a spice grinder or small mixer-grinder jar.</li>
            <li>Grind the toasted spices to a semi-fine powder, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Peel the skin off of the cooked potatoes, and chop them in ½ to 1 inch cubes.</li>
            <li> In a small skillet, heat 1 tablespoon oil. When the oil becomes medium hot then reduce the heat to low.

                Crackle ½ teaspoon cumin seeds until fragrant. I used mustard oil as it really adds a punch in the stuffing.</li>
            <li> Keep the heat on low and add 1 teaspoon finely chopped or minced ginger and 2 teaspoons finely chopped green chillies. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of ginger goes away.</li>
            <li>Now you can switch off the flame or keep flame to a low. Then add the cooked green peas, ½ teaspoon red chilli powder, 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing), the dry ground spice mix that we made and 1 to 2 teaspoons dry mango powder (amchur).</li>  
            <li> Stir together and sauté for a minute. You can add less or more dry mango powder depending upon personal taste.</li>  
            <li>Next add potato cubes, salt as required and 1 tablespoon chopped coriander leaves (also known as cilantro) to the skillet.</li>  
            <li>Mix very well and sauté for a minute. Check the taste, and add more of the spices, salt or dry mango powder if needed. </li>    
            <li>In a large mixing bowl combine 2 cups all-purpose flour (250 grams), 1 teaspoon carom seeds, 1 teaspoon salt and 6 tablespoons ghee (50 grams).</li>
            <li>With your fingers, mix the ingredients together until they make a breadcrumb-like texture that holds its shape when you press a portion of the mixture.</li>
            <li> Then, working just a bit at a time, add in 7 to 8 tablespoons water in parts and knead.</li>
            <li>Continue kneading to form a firm, tight dough. It should not be soft or sticky. Cover the dough with a moist kitchen towel and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the dough has rested, divide it into 6 to 7 even pieces. Take each piece and gently roll in your palms first to smooth and soften. Place it on your work surface or on the rolling board.</li>
            <li> Then roll it with a rolling pin, being mindful to keep the thickness even at 1 mm and not too thin.</li>
            <li>Carefully spoon and lightly pack the prepared potato and pea stuffing into the cone.</li>
            <li>. Evenly press all of the edges, making sure there are no cracks in the dough. The edges should be sealed very well so that the stuffing does not come out while frying.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil for deep frying in a kadai or pan. Test the oil by adding a small piece of dough – it should come up quickly if the oil is hot enough for frying.</li>
            <li>Fry them on low to medium-low heat, keeping an eye on them so they don't burn.</li>
            <li>Fry until each aloo samosa is crisp and golden. The oil will stop sizzling once the samosas are fried well. They will become nicely crisp and golden.</li>
            <li>Use a skimmer spoon or spider spoon to carefully remove fried samosa from the oil, and place them on paper towels to remove extra oil.</li>
            <li>Serve Punjabi Samosa hot or warm or at room temperature with Coriander Chutney or Tamarind Chutney, or with a zesty tomato ketchup.</li>
